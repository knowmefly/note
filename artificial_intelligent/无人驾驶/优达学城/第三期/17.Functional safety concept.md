### Lane Keeping Assistance Functional Safety Requirement
It can cut out after a moment for drivers misuse
### Safety Analysis Methods
sometime  mechanical archive 
-   Deriving safety requirements
-   Identifying conditions and causes that could lead to requirement violations
-   Identifying other hazards not identified in the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment

Different companies might use different methods including:
-   [Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis)    
-   [Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_and_operability_study)    
-   [Failure Modes Effects and Diagnostic Analysis FMEDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_modes,_effects,_and_diagnostic_analysis)  
-   [Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis)    
-   [Reliability Block Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_block_diagram)   
-   [ETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_tree_analysis)
