### ASIL
1. Here are a few examples of extra measures that need to be taken for higher ASILs:
	-   [Fault Tree Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis)  is mandatory for ASIL C and ASIL D
	-   ASIL D requires a hardware failure rate of no more than 10 failures per billion hours whereas ASIL B only requires a failure rate of no more than 100 failures per billion hours
	-   Software units with ASIL D require more rigorous testing like  [MC/DC coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage)  whereas ASIL B only mandates DC coverage.

### Five Steps to a Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment

To summarize, there are five steps to the hazard analysis and risk assessment:

-   Conduct a situational analysis
-   Identify malfunctions
-   Combine situations and malfunctions and assess risk
-   Determine ASILs
-   Derive safety goals
