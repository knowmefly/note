### Product Development Phase
The product development phase is divided into two parts:

- Product development at the system level
- Product development at the hardware and software level

ISO 26262 treats an item as if it were a system of systems. Take the lane assistance item as an example. The item has three systems:

- Vision system (camera)
- Display system (car dashboard)
- Motion system (electronic power steering)

Before developing hardware or software, the technical safety requirements need to be determined for each of these systems. And before the technical safety requirements can be determined for each system, the functional safety requirements need to be determined for the lane keeping item.

So the technical safety concept involves:

- Turning functional safety requirements into technical safety requirements
- Allocating technical safety requirements to the system architecture
