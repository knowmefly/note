	- ### Offline Training 
	- In this phase the goal is to feed some machine learning algorithm a lot of data to train it. For the trajectory clustering example this involved:

	1.  **Define similarity**  - we first need a definition of similarity that agrees with human common-sense definition.
	2.  **Unsupervised clustering**  - at this step some machine learning algorithm clusters the trajectories we've observed.
	3.  **Define Prototype Trajectories**  - for each cluster identify some small number of typical "prototype" trajectories.

	- ### Online Prediction
	4.  **Observe Partial Trajectory**  - As the target vehicle drives we can think of it leaving a "partial trajectory" behind it.
	5.  **Compare to Prototype Trajectories**  - We can compare this partial trajectory to the  _corresponding parts_  of the prototype trajectories. When these partial trajectories are more similar (using the same notion of similarity defined earlier) their likelihoods should increase relative to the other trajectories.
	6.  **Generate Predictions**  - For each cluster we identify the most likely prototype trajectory. We broadcast each of these trajectories along with the associated probability (see the image below).
