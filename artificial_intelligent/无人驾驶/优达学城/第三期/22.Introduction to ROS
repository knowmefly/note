# Turtlesim Comms: List Nodes
#### in the following concepts, we will investigate Turtlesimm Comms, and will cover the following steps:

1. Listing all active nodes
2. Listing all topics
3. Getting information about topics
4. Showing message information
5. Echoing messages in real-time

#### We can see that there are three active nodes that have been registered with the ROS Master, /rosout, /teleop_turtle, and /turtlesim.

- ==/rosout== This node is launched by roscore. It subscribes to the standard /rosout topic, the topic to which all nodes send log messages.
- ==/teleop_turtle== This is our keyboard teleop node. Notice that it’s not named turtle_teleop_key. There’s no requirement that a node’s broadcasted name is the same as the name of it’s associated executable.
- ==/turtlesim== The node name associated with the turtlebot_sim node
